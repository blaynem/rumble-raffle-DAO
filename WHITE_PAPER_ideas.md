# **Activities**

Activities are any sort of event that happens within a given Rumble Raffle game. They create a fun and evolving ecosystem with user generated content. Holding activities will earn you extra RUMBLE tokens.

## **How are activities minted?**

All activities will be available to be minted at a TBD price.

## **Benefits to holding**

1. **Passive Income**. Holders of any Activities (NFT) will earn tokens any time their activity is used across the Rumble platform. Holders do not need to participate in order to recieve these benefits.

2. Depending on the rarity of the activity, users will recieve a reward multiplier.

3. Holders may stake the activities in order to recieve even greater rewards. See the rewards table below.

### **Activity Rewards By Rarity**

Actual values still TBD.

|                          |  Common  |   Rare   |   Epic   | Legendary |
| ------------------------ | :------: | :------: | :------: | :-------: |
| **Un-staked Default**    | 1 RUMBLE | 2 RUMBLE | 3 RUMBLE | 5 RUMBLE  |
| **6 Months Multiplier**  |    2x    |    3x    |    4x    |    5x     |
| **12 Months Multiplier** |    5x    |    7x    |    9x    |    12x    |

## **Will future activities be minted?**

Most likely.

In order to keep an interest in Rumble Raffle, we believe there needs to be constant additions of new activities. These additions will most likely be minted with RUMBLE token as payment. That payment being returned as revdis or burned entirely.

# **Game Modes**

## **HARDCORE Mode**

- Players will select their weapons and armor to build the best stats they can.
- They will then face off. Winners will recieve massive rewards, those who perish will have their NFTs burned.
- (All of this TBD)

## **DEATHROLL APP**

- In WoW we would deathroll our gold. How it works:
  - Challenge someone to deathroll of x value. you'd type `/roll x` and it would randomly pick a number between 1 and x.
  - Ex: "I challenge you to roll of `50,000` coins"
  - Person who started the game would type `/roll 500000`
  - the console would spit out random number `Blah rolled: 34562`
  - You repeat this until the last person rolls `1`. That person would then owe the other person the `50,000`

## **HIGH ROLLER**

- You would set the game to go off of `10,000`
- 20 people agree to roll `/roll 10000` each
- The person who rolled the lowest then owes the person who rolled the highest, the difference between theyre rolls.
- ex: Person1 rolls `120` Person2 rolls `9450`. Person 1 then pays `9450 -120` to Person 2.

# **Profile Pictures**

- Rumble Raffle specific PFPs based on what you own?
  - Weapons, armor, helmet (they do nothing. Just for flexing)
- External NFT PFPs (different options)
  1. Show the NFT
  2. Implement weapon layers or a "serum" similar to BAYC that could be used to add weapons to your NFT?

# **Non Fungible Ted**

- Similar to ethlizards, etc.
  - 50% of proceeds go to the Treasury which is used to invest in.. things?
  - Remaining is allocated to team and marketing.
- Governance? Special Drops for Rumble Raffle DAO?
- Extra perks in Rumble Raffle DAO
- Different bibs, hairstyles, mouth, eyes, colors, patterns
- x amount of legendaries
  - Spag-teddi: A Ted but everything is spaghetti noodles / sauce / meatballs.
  - Teddy Borksevelt: Teddy Roosevelt look-alike
  - Rescue Ted: Newfies are rescue dogs, so it'll have lifeguard things. Think Baywatch. Glasses, sunscreen nose, big fluffy chest hair, shorts.
  - Theodore Tedville: Alvin and the chipmunks ted
  - Wacdonalds Ted: Everyone is doing it I guess. idk
  - GIF: prancing shiny ted
  - NASA Ted
  - Dead Ted: He's a spooky scary skeleton

# **Throwaway Bonus Ideas**

- Purchas in game badges, armor, or accessories with RUMBLE tokens?
- Something similar to twitches "Predictions"
  - When it gets down to the last 5 people we pause for 30 seconds and allow people to predict who might win. Winners earn extra tokens or something idk.
- "Entrances" like in WWE games. Maybe it quickly scrolls through people with weapons and you can show weapon / name / other things like how many kills theyve got or wins theyve got.
- Separate sort of "pay2win" mode where armor and weapons actually have an affect on your stats, though its still completely random. Armor gives you 2 hit points or something. While weapons maybe give you a chance to dodge or hit harder. There is an entrance fee of x RUMBLE token as well.
- Can make a Rumble PFP NFT as well, charging RUMBLE to mint.
