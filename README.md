# Rumble Birds

It uhh does some battle with birbs.


## Context

[src/App.tsx](src/App.tsx) is the main test UI

[src/Rumble](src/Rumble/) is the entry into the rumble code

[Rumble/types](src/Rumble/types/) is where Typescript types can be found

[Rumble/activities](src/Rumble/activities/) activities are events that can happen. These will be either PVP, PVP or a Revive activity.

### Extra Monetary Ideas

- NFT Ideas
  - Winners get NFT's (Gold/Silver/Bronze)
    - Can sell the NFT, but we always get a 5% cut or whatever is the norm.
    - Can trade the NFT up for higher win score NFTs or something?
    - A certain amount of wins can let you burn the NFTs for ability to add your own naming of the activity (pve/pvp/revive round)
- DAO Token?
  - Do similar things as the NFT idea? (I like the NFT idea better, it gives more cashflow for people that may want to buy 5 or whatever winning rounds to make suggestions)
  - Can vote on things that are implement? idk
  - Good to just release and get cashflow as well.
