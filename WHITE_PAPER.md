# **Rumble Raffle White Paper**

Welcome to Rumble Raffle.

A free to play, completely random game where you can earn RUMBLE tokens. Create and upgrade weapons to use in battle in order to earn more RUMBLE tokens. Reroll your weapons to get the perfect secondary stats!

## **How It Works**

It's as simple 1, 2, 3.

1. Connect with metamask
2. Sign the required message
3. Click "Join Game"

Congratulations, you just entered a completely random raffle where you have the chance to win rewards!

While anyone may join a Rumble Raffle and earn RUMBLE tokens for winning a game, only holders of the Rumble NFTs will earn extra rewards. [See this table for more info.](#weapon-rewards-by-rarity)

*Note: Weapons do not affect the outcome of the game, games winners will always remain completely random. However, you must own a weapon in order to earn special rewards.*

## **In-game Scenarios**

There are 3 activity types that may be chosen throughout a game at random. Player vs Player (PVP), Player vs Environment (PVE), and a Revive. While PVE does sound like it's safe from death and dismemberment, be extra careful when stopping to smell the roses...

**PVP Examples**
```
PLAYER_0 killed PLAYER_1 with a knife.
PLAYER_0 and PLAYER_1 teamed up and ate PLAYER_2 alive.
```

**PVE Examples**
```
PLAYER_0 took a stroll through the tulip fields.
PLAYER_0 drank infected water and died.
PLAYER_0 and PLAYER_1 tried to start a fire to stay warm using their own bodies as tinder.
```

**Revive Examples**
```
The population of heaven just decreased, because PLAYER_0 is back!
PLAYER_0 has risen from the dead. Is that a zombie?
```

## **Seasons**

In order to keep Rumble Raffle a fun and exciting experience, we will iterate over the activities that players come across by introducing seasons. With seasons come new and exciting themes. Some examples could be pirates, futuristic, etc.

# **Rumble Token**

Rumble Tokens are a reward earned by:
- Winning a game
- Joining a game (*)
- Getting kills in a game (*)

\* *Must hold a Weapon NFT in order to earn reward*


## **How Many Tokens are there?**

TBD. Dogecoin has 100 Billion tokens. FNC has 1 Billion. 

## **Tokenomics**

TBD.

## **Why would I want Rumble Tokens?**

1. RUMBLE tokens allow you to purchase and upgrade weapons. By holding a weapon you'll be able to earn increased rewards when participating in a rumble. Weapons will also unlock additional rewards (ex: additional entries to raffles). [Learn about weapons](#weapons).
2. RUMBLE Tokens can be staked to earn passive income. Stakers will earn 100% of in-game revdis.
3. RUMBLE Tokens may have more utility in the future that has yet to be determined!


## **How are RUMBLE tokens earned?**

1. Winning games. [See table for more info.](#weapon-rewards-by-rarity)
2. Getting kills while owning a Weapon (NFT). [See table for more info.](#weapon-rewards-by-rarity)
3. Staking RUMBLE Token. Stakers will earn 100% of revdis.


## **Token Mechanics**

1. Any time a weapon is purchased or upgraded `100%` of the token will be returned to the stakers.
2. There will be special Rumble Raffles where you can purchase up to 10 additional entries. That fee will go to the prize pool. `70%` of the prize pool will be distributed to the top 3 players, while the remaining `30%` will be returned as revdis. (Definite numbers TBD)

# **Weapons**

Weapons have **no impact** on games, however there will be many benefits to holding them.

## **Benefits**

While any player may earn 1 RUMBLE token by being the winner, only a Weapon Holder will be able to earn rewards at a heavily increased rate.

1. Owning a weapon let's you earn extra tokens by simply joining a game, no matter the outcome.

2. Weapon holders will receive a multiplier of tokens earned when getting kills. This multiplier depends on the weapons rarity + shiny status. (See chart below.)

3. Weapon holders will recieve multiple free entries, on top of the initial free entry, to future external Whitelist / NFT raffles. (Think Yuga Labs / WW / Fluf mints, etc)

4. Complete quests to earn even more rewards. (Quests TBD)


### **Weapon Rewards by Rarity**

Common rarity recieves very little rewards, as we want to incentivize players to participate in more games and ultimately upgrade their weapons.

|           | **Join Game** | **Reward Per Kill** | **Chance of Pay on Kill** | **Pay Chance Increase(*)** | **Win Game**
| ---       | :---:         | ---                 | :---:                     | :---:                      | --- 
No Weapon   | 0 RUMBLE      | 0 RUMBLE            | 0%                        | 0%                         | 1 RUMBLE
Common      | 1 RUMBLE      | 0 RUMBLE            | 0%                        | 0%                         | 2 RUMBLE
Rare        | 1 RUMBLE      | 1 RUMBLE            | 10-30%                    | 2-8%                       | 2-4 RUMBLE
Epic        | 1 RUMBLE      | 2 RUMBLE            | 35-55%                    | 3-9%                       | 3-5 RUMBLE
Legendary   | 1 RUMBLE      | 3 RUMBLE            | 55-75%                    | 7-11%                      | 6-10 RUMBLE
Shiny Bonus | 2x            | 1.5x                | +10%                      | 0%                         | 2x

\* There is an `x%` chance that you will recieve `y` RUMBLE tokens on a kill as payment. If you do recieve this payment, the percent chance will increase by `10%`. This repeats until the chance of payment is `100%`.

Example: `30%` chance to get paid for a kill. If I get paid for a kill, the next time I make a kill there is a `40%` (`30%` + `10%`) chance that I will get paid once more.

## **How are weapons minted?**

After the initial minting phase, common weapons will be purchasable for 100 RUMBLE.

## **How are weapons upgraded?**

By paying a fee + burning the previous weapon, players will be able to upgrade the rarity of their weapons. They also have the ability to reroll their weapons stats by paying a certain fee.

The following stats will be randomly selected when a weapon is upgraded or rerolled:
- "Chance of Pay on Kill"
- "Pay Chance Increase"
- Shiny? True or False
- Winning Game Payout

Example of costs below, actual costs TBD.

|               | Upgrade Cost | Reroll Cost |
| ---           | ---          | ---         |
| **Common**    | 1k RUMBLE    | N/A         |
| **Rare**      | 5k RUMBLE    | 100 RUMBLE  |
| **Epic**      | 10k RUMBLE   | 500 RUMBLE  |
| **Legendary** | 1 M RUMBLE   | 10k RUMBLE  |

## **Where do the fees go?**

The fees are returned `100%` back to stakers of RUMBLE token.

## **How many weapons can I hold?**

While you are free to collect as many as you like, you will only get rewards for your single highest rarity weapon.

## **Weapon Seasons**

In order to create an ever evolving ecosystem, every ~6-12 months there may be a new season of weapons. Old weapons may earn heavily reduced rewards, though they may have a future use case.

# **Future Game Modes**

While the first iteration of Rumble Raffle will mostly be around building a community and ironing out all of these details, our goal is to have much more meaningful game modes in the future.

There will always be the for fun game modes, though we want to raise the stakes. Choose your armor, weapons etc and battle it out. Survivors will receive massive rewards, those who perish will lose it all.
