# **Rumble Raffle White Paper**

Welcome to Rumble Raffle.

A free to play, completely random game where you can earn RUMBLE tokens. Battle other participants, create and upgrade weapons to earn more RUMBLE tokens. Reroll to get the perfect stats!

## **How It Works**

Click "Connect Metamask" to sign in. Then click "Join Game".

Congratulations! You just entered a completely random raffle where you have the chance to win prizes.

While anyone may join a Rumble Raffle and earn RUMBLE tokens for winning a game, only holders of the Rumble NFTs will earn extra rewards. [See this table for more info.](#weapon-rewards-by-rarity)

*Note: Weapons do not affect the outcome of the game, they are completely random. You must own a weapon in order to earn special rewards.*

Below you will find the collection of thoughts and ideas around the Rumble Raffle DAO ecosystem.

# **Rumble Token**

Rumble Token is the reward earned for participating in, getting kills in, or being the last man standing in a rumble game. Tokens can also be earned by staking RUMBLE or holding an Activity NFT.

## **How Many Tokens are there?**

TBD. Dogecoin has 100 Billion tokens. FNC has 1 Billion. 

## **Tokenomics**

TBD.

## **Why would I want Rumble Tokens?**

1. RUMBLE tokens allow you to purchase and upgrade weapons. By holding a weapon you'll be able to earn increased rewards when participating in a rumble. [Learn about weapons](#weapons).
2. RUMBLE tokens will be the only currency used to mint additional Activity NFTs. [Learn about activities](#activities).
3. RUMBLE Tokens can be staked to earn passive income. Stakers will earn 100% of in-game revdis.
4. And much more to be determined!


## **How are RUMBLE tokens earned?**

1. Winning games. [See table for more info.](#weapon-rewards-by-rarity)
2. Getting kills while owning a Weapon (NFT). [See table for more info.](#weapon-rewards-by-rarity)
3. Owning an Activity (NFT). Rewards are recieved any time your activity is picked across the Rumble platform. There will be a multiplier if you stake your activity. [See table for more info.](#activity-rewards-by-rarity)
4. Staking RUMBLE Token. Stakers will earn 100% of revdis.


## **Token Burn Mechanisms**

If we decide to go deflationary, these are the burning mechanisms we can have in place.

1. Any time a weapon is purchased or upgraded, `50%` of the token will be burnt. The remaining `50%` will be returned to the stakers.
2. There will be special Rumble Raffles where you can purchase up to 10 additional entries. That fee will go to the prize pool. `10%` will be burned, `10%` will be returned as revdis, the remaining prize pool will be distrubuted to the top 3 remaining players. (Definite numbers TBD)
3. Purchasing in game badges and accessories.
4. Armor? Is simply a badge inside the game of some sort. 
5. Badges? Maybe specific PFPs or something? idk

If we decide to not have burn mechanics, we can instead give `100%` of that revenue back to stackers.

# **Weapons**

Weapons have **no impact** on games, however there will be many benefits to holding them.

While any player may earn 1 RUMBLE token by being the winner, only a Weapon Holder will be able to earn rewards at a heavily increased rate.

## **Benefits**

1. Weapon holders will receive a multiplier of tokens earned when getting kills. This multiplier depends on the weapons rarity + shiny status. (See chart below.)

2. Weapon holders will recieve multiple free entries, on top of the initial free entry, to future external Whitelist / NFT raffles. (Think Yuga Labs / WW / Fluf mints, etc)


### **Weapon Rewards by Rarity**

Common recieves very little rewards, as we want to incentivize players to participate in more games.

|           | **Reward Per Kill** | **Chance of Pay on Kill** | **Pay Chance Increase(*)** | **Win Game** 
| ---       | ---                 | :---:                     | :---:                      | ---
No Weapon   | 0 RUMBLE            | 0%                        | 0%                         | 1 RUMBLE
Common      | 0 RUMBLE            | 0%                        | 0%                         | 2 RUMBLE
Rare        | 1 RUMBLE            | 10-30%                    | 2-8%                       | 2-4 RUMBLE
Epic        | 2 RUMBLE            | 35-55%                    | 3-9%                       | 3-5 RUMBLE
Legendary   | 3 RUMBLE            | 55-75%                    | 7-11%                      | 6-10 RUMBLE
Shiny Bonus | 1.5x                | +10%                      | 0%                         | 2x

\* There is an `x%` chance that you will recieve `y` RUMBLE tokens on a kill as payment. If you do recieve this payment, the percent chance will increase by `10%`. This repeats until the chance of payment is `100%`.

Example: `30%` chance to get paid for a kill. If I get paid for a kill, the next time I make a kill there is a `40%` (`30%` + `10%`) chance that I will get paid once more.

## **How are weapons minted?**

After the initial minting phase, common weapons will be purchasable for 100 RUMBLE.

## **How are weapons upgraded?**

By paying a fee + burning the previous weapon, players will be able to upgrade the rarity of their weapons. They also have the ability to reroll their weapons stats by paying a certain fee.

The following stats will be randomly selected when a weapon is upgraded or rerolled:
- "Chance of Pay on Kill"
- "Pay Chance Increase"
- Shiny? True or False
- Winning Game Payout

Actual costs TBD.

|               | Upgrade Cost | Reroll Cost |
| ---           | ---          | ---         |
| **Common**    | 1k RUMBLE    | N/A         |
| **Rare**      | 5k RUMBLE    | 100 RUMBLE  |
| **Epic**      | 10k RUMBLE   | 500 RUMBLE  |
| **Legendary** | 1 M RUMBLE   | 10k RUMBLE  |

## **Where do the fees go?**

The fees are returned `100%` back to stakers of RUMBLE token.

## **How many weapons can I hold?**

One (1). Feel free to collect as many as you like! Though you will only get rewards for your single highest rarity weapon.

## **Weapon Seasons**

In order to create an ever evolving ecosystem, every ~6-12 months should be a new season of weapons. Old weapons will no longer be able to earn extra token rewards, though maybe they will have a future use case.

Ex:
- Season 1: very basic sticks, bows, rocks, simple weapons
- Season 2: medieval weapons mace, halberd, swords
- Season 3: guns? Or just straight to rayguns and future tech?

# **Activities**

Activities are the bread and butter of Rumble Raffle. They create a fun and evolving ecosystem with user generated content.

## **How are activities minted?**

All activities will be available to be minted at a TBD price.

## **Benefits**

1. **Passive Income**. Holders of any Activities (NFT) will earn tokens any time their activity is used across the Rumble platform. Holders do not need to participate in order to recieve these benefits.

2. Depending on the rarity of the activity, users will recieve a reward multiplier.

3. Holders may stake the activities in order to recieve even greater rewards. See the rewards table below.

### **Activity Rewards By Rarity** 
Actual values still TBD.

|                          | Common   | Rare     | Epic     | Legendary
|       ---                | :---:    | :---:    | :---:    | :---:
| **Un-staked Default**    | 1 RUMBLE | 2 RUMBLE | 3 RUMBLE | 5 RUMBLE
| **6 Months Multiplier**  | 2x       | 3x       | 4x       | 5x
| **12 Months Multiplier** | 5x       | 7x       | 9x       | 12x

## **Will future activities be minted?**

Most likely. 

In order to keep an interest in Rumble Raffle, we believe there needs to be constant additions of new activities. These additions will most likely be minted with RUMBLE token as payment. That payment being returned as revdis or burned entirely.

    - Spag-teddi: A Ted but everything is spaghetti noodles / sauce / meatballs.
    - Teddy Borksevelt: Teddy Roosevelt look-alike

# **Throwaway Bonus Ideas**

- Something similar to twitches "Predictions"
  - When it gets down to the last 5 people we pause for 30 seconds and allow people to predict who might win. Winners earn extra tokens or something idk.
- "Entrances" like in WWE games. Maybe it quickly scrolls through people with weapons and you can show weapon / name / other things like how many kills theyve got or wins theyve got.
- Separate sort of "pay2win" mode where armor and weapons actually have an affect on your stats, though its still completely random. Armor gives you 2 hit points or something. While weapons maybe give you a chance to dodge or hit harder. There is an entrance fee of x RUMBLE token as well.
- Can make a Rumble PFP NFT as well, charging RUMBLE to mint.
