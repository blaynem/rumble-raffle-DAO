- [Weapons (NFT)](#weapons)
- [Activites (NFT)](#activities)
- [Non Fungible Ted (NFTed)](#non-fungible-ted)


# **Rumble Token**

Rumble Token will be the currency used in order to play any of the current or future Rumble games.


### **How Many?**

TBD. Dogecoin has 100 Billion tokens. FNC has 1 Billion. 


### **Why?**

When you visit somewhere like Dave And Busters or Chuck E Cheese, they have a token system. You pay $x and get x of Tokens. This "locks" you into using these tokens to play their games, while giving you certain rewards in return.

Ultimately, players will have more fun when seeing higher numbers of tokens being thrown around in the game. So while we could base prices off of wETH (or any alt coin), it feels better seeing you win 1000+ Rumble Tokens than it does seeing .05 wETH rewards.


### **Tokenomics**

TBD.


### **Use Cases**

1. Used as Entry Fee into any Rumble Raffle or subsequent Rumble game releases (Deathroll / High Roller).
2. Can be used to purchase Rumble NFTs (Weapons / Activities) that will earn rewards for holding.
3. Can be used to purchase in game things like badges?
4. Staking?


### **How are they earned?**

1. Winning games
2. Getting kills
3. If you own an NFT weapon, armor, etc you get bonus tokens.
4. If you own an NFT Activity and your activity is picked, you get bonus tokens.
5. Staking?


### **Burn Mechanisms**

1. Every rumble raffle, where the entry fee is in Rumble Token, will have a percentage of the prize pool burned.
2. Purchasing any Rumble NFTs (Weapons / Activity) should burn the token.
3. Purchasing in game badges.

### **Throwaway Ideas**

- Something similar to twitches "Predictions"

# **Weapons**

Weapons have no impact on the outcome of a game, though they have other perks.


### **Benefits**

Holders of weapons will receive a multiplier of tokens earned when getting kills, regardless of if the weapon was used or not. This multiplier depending entirely on weapon rarity.

Holders will need to participate in order to recieve this multiplier.

The multiplier below is strictly an example.

Rarity    | Multiplier | Total Amt
----------|:----------:|:---------:
Legendary | 5x         | 50
Epic      | 3x         | 500
Rare      | 2x         | 1000
Common    | 1.5x       | 2000


### **Should it be purchased through a Rumble Token or via a mint?**

Token                         | Mint
:---:                         | :---:
Gives a usecase for a token   | Initial seed funding and excitement
Another avenue to burn tokens |


### **If minted, should it also be purchased via token?**
Leaning no

Yes                                  | No
:---:                                | :---:
Gives more usecases for our tokens   | Reduces rarity / scarcity of weapons
More reason to participate           | Reducing the potential revenue from selling of weapons on opensea


<br>

# **Activities**

Activities are the bread and butter of Rumble Raffle. They create a fun and evolving ecosystem with user generated content.


### **Benefits**

Holders of the activities will receive a multiplier of tokens earned whenever their event is used.

Holders **will not** need to participate in order to recieve this multiplier.

The multiplier below is strictly an example.

Rarity    | Multiplier | Total Amt
----------|:----------:|:---------:
Legendary | 5x         | 50
Epic      | 3x         | 500
Rare      | 1.5x       | 1000
Common    | 1x         | 2000


### **Should it be purchased through a Rumble Token or via a mint?**

Ownership of all initially created phrases will be ownable and minted.


### **If minted, should it also be purchased via token?**

TBD.

Leaning yes, though there should be a limit on how many more will be created.

Yes                                  | No
:---:                                | :---:
Burn mechanisms for Rumble Token     | Reduces chance activities will be played
Community driven content             | Reduces potential revenue from selling on opensea
Increases replayability              |

# **Non Fungible Ted**
  - Similar to ethlizards, etc.
    - 50% of proceeds go to the Treasury which is used to invest in.. things?
    - Remaining is allocated to team and marketing.
  - Governance? Special Drops for Rumble Raffle DAO?
  - Extra perks in Rumble Raffle DAO
  - Different bibs, hairstyles, mouth, eyes, colors, patterns
  - x amount of legendaries
    - Spag-teddi: A Ted but everything is spaghetti noodles / sauce / meatballs.
    - Teddy Borksevelt: Teddy Roosevelt look-alike
    - Rescue Ted: Newfies are rescue dogs, so it'll have lifeguard things. Think Baywatch. Glasses, sunscreen nose, big fluffy chest hair, shorts.
    - Theodore Tedville: Alvin and the chipmunks ted
    - Wacdonalds Ted: Everyone is doing it I guess. idk
    - GIF: prancing shiny ted

# **Extra Token Burn Mechanism Ideas**

## **Armor**
- Purchasable via Rumble token.
- Does nothing, is entirely a viewable badge or something inside of the game.
  - Somewhat of a utility, but not really.
  - Most likely better as a badge of some sort.

## **Badges**
- How many wins you've gotten, etc
- Similar idea to the Rumble specific PFPs (weapons, armor, etc)
