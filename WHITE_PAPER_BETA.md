## **In-game Scenarios**

There are 3 activity types that may be chosen throughout a game at random. Player vs Player (PVP), Player vs Environment (PVE), and a Revive. While PVE does sound like it's safe from death and dismemberment, be extra careful when stopping to smell the roses...

**PVP Examples**
```
PLAYER_0 killed PLAYER_1 with a knife.
PLAYER_0 and PLAYER_1 teamed up and ate PLAYER_2 alive.
```

**PVE Examples**
```
PLAYER_0 took a stroll through the tulip fields.
PLAYER_0 drank infected water and died.
PLAYER_0 and PLAYER_1 tried to start a fire to stay warm using their own bodies as tinder.
```

**Revive Examples**
```
The population of heaven just decreased, because PLAYER_0 is back!
PLAYER_0 has risen from the dead. Is that a zombie?
```
